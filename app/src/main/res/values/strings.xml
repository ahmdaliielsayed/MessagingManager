We promise to provide you with the right solution when technically available. Thank you for your understanding\n\n<b>Mandatory Requirement: Optimization of battery use improvement</b>\nOn some Android devices, improved battery usage cancels the accessibility service automatically after an idle period, causing the failure to send scheduled WhatsApp messages.
